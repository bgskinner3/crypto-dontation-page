# Smart contract and Metamask donation 

</br>

We developed a basic React application that utilizes Ganache as a local testing network to evaluate our smart contract.

The smart contract accepts donations and allows for withdrawal to the presently authenticated user with Metamask.

It's important to note that this is entirely experimental and should not be deployed to the Ethereum mainnet.
